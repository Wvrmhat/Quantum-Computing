	+ Ising model: The traditional ising model is used to describe ferromagnetism in stats mechanics. It consists of spins that can be in a state of (+1 or -1). The energy is determined by the alignment of these spins. (it helps identify phase transitions of matter).

	Ferromagnetism: The way certain materials are attracted to one another. It is responsible for magnetism in magnets.

	Delta-pulsed transverse magnetic field: A magnetic field applied in short intense bursts that are perpendicular to a direction.

	Hamiltonian: operator that corresponds to total energy of that system, including kinetic and potential energy. (𝐻^ = 𝑇^ + 𝑉^)

	Trotterization:

> **Kicked Ising model**: The system is influenced by an external force usually a delta-pulsed magnetic field. This force gives a time-dependent component which can lead to more complex dynamics (possibly new phases of matter).
