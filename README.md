# Quantum Computing 
Makes use of qubits, can be in any state at once when unobserved known as superposition. However when it is observed/measured then it has to decide on a state.

Entanglement: a connection where qubit's react to a changed in another qubit instantly. Therefore when measuring one entangled qubit, you can determine the properties of it's partners.

Qubit manipulation: 
Quantum gates are applied to qubits to entangle them and manipulate probabilities. The outcome collapses the superposition to a sequence of 0s and 1s. Allowing all calculations to be done at the same time. It does not "try all the options", it decides the most likely answer.
> Normal logic gates take a set of inputs and has one definite output
> Exploiting superposition and entanglement would be more efficient than whatever would be possible on normal computer
